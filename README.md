Solar Dex is the ONLY DEX that offers investors a streamlined and safe Defi exchange with our:

automatic liquidity lockers natively built into pool creations.

This means that projects and investors no longer need to worry about rug pulls. We provide a liquidity locker seamlessly in pool deployement if a project chooses to lock there liquidity. If projects choose NOT to lock liquidity, they have that option as well.

For investors sakes though, it would be highlighted as "Not Locked" on the swap page. Vice versa if liquidity is "Locked" - the length of the lock would be called out on the swap page as well.

Not only did we want to create the first ever way to streamline safety and try to eliminate rug pulls, - we will also eliminate the need for investors to navigate to several sites to make an investment decision by providing upfront analytics to everyone - including team members on there project
